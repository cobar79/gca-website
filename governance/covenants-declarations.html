                                        through its Board of Directors. The common elements shall remain undivided, and
                                        shall at all times be owned by the Association or its successors, who shall
                                        neither abandon, partition, sell, gift, or subdivide any portion of the property
                                        without the prior approval of owners of lots to which at least sixty-seven
                                        percent of the votes in the Association are allocated, it being agreed that this
                                        restriction is necessary in order to preserve the rights of the owners within
                                        the Association with respect to the operation and management of the common area.

                    </div>
                    <div class="container left">It is the policy of the Gleneagle Civic Association (GCA), a Colorado
                        nonprofit corporation, as successor in interest to the declarant with respect to the Declaration
                        of Covenants, Restrictions, and Charges for Gleneagle subdivisions, to enforce compliance with
                        these covenants on the part of all property owners and residents within the GCA community in an
                        equitable and consistent manner. This will be accomplished through a Covenants Control Committee
                        (CCC) made up of GCA members reporting to the GCA Board of Directors. The CCC will make periodic
                        surveys of the GCA neighborhood for covenants compliance, take note of complaints submitted by
                        any residents or owners, and report all violations and complaints to the Board. Thereafter, the
                        Board may effect correction of such reported infractions. All actions taken pursuant to this
                        Policy Memorandum shall be authorized by and within the scope of Section 146 of the Declaration.

                    <h3>Procedures</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12"><strong>The Covenants Control Committee &ndash;</strong> The Covenants Control
                    Committee will comprise a chairman and at least four members. The chairman shall be a member of the
                    Board of Directors of the Association. Each of the four regions of the GCA community &ndash;
                    Northeast, Northwest, Central, and South -- will be the responsibility of at least one member of the
                    CCC with respect to covenants enforcement.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Survey &ndash;</strong> Members of the CCC will conduct surveys of
                    their respective regions approximately once per month and take note of any apparent covenant
                    infractions readily visible from the street. They will also note any construction, landscaping or
                    major maintenance projects underway.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Infractions &ndash;</strong> Infractions will be categorized as
                    either transient or non-transient in accordance with a list derived from descriptions contained in
                    the covenants and approved by the Board of Directors.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Complaints &ndash;</strong> Any resident of the GCA community may
                    report a possible transient or non-transient covenants infraction to a member of the CCC or the
                    Board of Directors.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Construction, Landscaping and Major Maintenance Projects
                        &ndash;</strong> All such projects noted in the surveys or identified by a resident will be
                    brought to the attention of the chairman of the Architectural Control Committee (ACC). In cases
                    where the chairman of the ACC has not approved a project, it will be treated as a non-transient
                    infraction.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Initial Contact Regarding an Infraction &ndash;</strong> Upon
                    receiving notice of an infraction from the CCC or from a resident of the GCA community, the Board
                    shall cause a letter to be sent to the resident of the affected property identifying the infraction
                    to his/her attention and requesting correction within 30 days for non-transient infractions and 7
                    days for transient infractions. In cases where the resident is not an owner, e.g. a lessee, a copy
                    of the letter will be sent to the owner. The letter will be signed by the CCC Chairperson or another
                    GCA Board member, and a phone number will be provided for the resident or owner, as appropriate, to
                    call for more information, if desired. The Board will maintain a list of all covenant issues being
                    addressed within the community at any given time.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Initial Follow-up &ndash;</strong> Approximately 10 days after a
                    letter declaring a transient infraction is sent or 35 days after a letter declaring a non-transient
                    infraction is sent, a CCC member will inspect the residence to see if the infraction has been
                    remedied. For infractions that have not been corrected, but the resident or owner has stated his/her
                    intention to take action, the Board may exercise judgment about whether to allow additional time
                    before taking further action.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Subsequent Follow-up &ndash;</strong> In the case of infractions
                    for which no response is received or observed, the Board will send a second letter entitled SECOND
                    NOTICE by certified mail to the same addressees as previously notified. The Second Notice will note
                    the infraction, the earlier letter, the lack of response, and the action that may be taken; the
                    Owner&rsquo;s right to be heard, either orally or in writing, by a committee appointed by the Board
                    at a meeting of the Board which is at least fifteen (15) days after the date of the notice; the date
                    on which the hearing will be scheduled; and if the Respondent fails to appear at the specified date
                    and time or otherwise respond to the Complaint, the Board will proceed with or without a hearing, at
                    its discretion, to make its determination of the allegations contained in the Complaint based on all
                    relevant facts and circumstances.</div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Hearing &ndash;</strong> Each hearing shall be held at the
                    scheduled time, place and date, unless the Owner has failed to respond or appear at the hearing. The
                    Board may grant continuances for good cause. Each hearing shall be held by a Hearing Committee. The
                    Hearing Committee shall consist of a person or persons appointed by the Board, which may be the
                    Board itself, who do not have any direct personal or financial interest in the outcome of the
                    hearing. A person is deemed not to have a direct personal or financial interest if he/she will not
                    receive any greater benefit or detriment from the outcome than will the general membership of the
                    Association.<br><br>The Hearing Committee may:

                        <li class="top10 alphaParen">act as it may deem appropriate or desirable to permit it to reach a
                            just decision. The Owner need not be in attendance at the hearing, but is encouraged to
                            attend. Any decision by the Hearing Committee shall be fair and reasonable taking into
                            consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 top10"><strong>Decision &ndash;</strong> If the Owner does not appear but a
                    written response is filed, the Hearing Committee shall render its decision based on the information
                    available to it, including any written response, considering all of the relevant facts and
                    circumstances. If neither an appearance nor a written response is made by the Owner, the Hearing
                    Committee need not conduct a hearing or make any further findings except that it may determine that
                    the Owner&rsquo;s failure to appear or respond constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing, and
                    impose the sanctions provided for herein. If an appearance is made, after all testimony and other
                    evidence has been presented to the Hearing Committee at a hearing, the Hearing Committee shall
                    render its decision(s), taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances. If
                    the Hearing Committee does not inform the Owner of its decision at the time of the hearing, or if no
                    hearing is held, the Hearing Committee will provide a written notice of the decision to the
                    Owner&rsquo;s address of record via regular U.S. mail.</div>

                    Rules and Regulations by any means available to the Association, including, but not limited to,
                    commencement of a lawsuit to force compliance or seeking injunctive relief or damages. The
                    Association shall be entitled to reimbursement of all reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs
                    incurred by the Association in connection with any enforcement action, including any proceeding
                    under this policy. Without limiting the Association&rsquo;s remedies under the Documents, the
                    Hearing Committee may assess fines, suspend membership privileges, and impose other sanctions in
                    accordance with this policy. If the violation involves damage to Association property, the violator

                    accumulates more than three (3) violations within a twelve (12) month period will be deemed to be a
                    habitual offender. For habitual offenders, continuing violations, or violations which have an
                    indefinite commencement or termination date, the Hearing Committee may impose such additional fines
                    as are deemed reasonable by the Hearing Committee without regard to the schedule set forth below.

                    of the Documents, or based on the severity of the violation, the Hearing Committee may impose such
