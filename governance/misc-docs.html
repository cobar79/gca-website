          <li id="art2-1"><u>Membership</u>. Membership in the Association shall be as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation of the
            Association and the Amended and Restated Declaration. Such membership shall terminate without any formal
            Association action whenever such person ceases to be the Owner of a Lot, but such termination shall not
            relieve or release any such former Owner from any liability or obligation incurred under or in any way
            connected with this Association during the period of such ownership and membership in the Association, or
            impair any rights or remedies which the Lot Owners have, either through the Board of Directors of the
            Association or directly, against such former owner and Member arising out of or in any way connected with
            ownership and membership and the covenants and obligations incident thereto.
          </li>
          <li id="art2-2" class="top10"><u>Voting</u>. Each membership shall have the vote(s) appurtenant thereto as described in the Amended and
            Restated Declaration. When more than one person holds the membership, they shall appoint one of their comembers as proxy to cast the vote
            for that membership. Such vote shall be cast as the Owners thereof agree, but in no event shall more than one vote per question be cast
            with respect to any one membership. If the comembers cannot agree as to the manner in which their vote should be cast when called upon
            to vote, then they will be treated as having abstained.

          <li id="art2-3" class="top10"><u>Quorum &amp; Proxies</u>. Except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws and in the Amended and Restated
            Declaration, the presence in person or by proxy of Members holding twenty percent (20%) of the Votes entitled to be cast shall constitute
            a quorum. Unless otherwise specifically provided by the Amended and Restated Declaration, the Articles of Incorporation of the
            Association, or these Bylaws, all matters coming before a meeting of members at which a proper quorum is in attendance, in person and/or
            by proxy, shall be decided by the vote of a majority of the votes validly cast at such meeting. Regarding matters presented to the
            Members individually and in writing in the form of a ballot, such properly completed and validated ballots shall be counted towards
            achievement of a quorum and the subsequent decision regarding each matter addressed in the ballot.

  <div class="row top20">
    <div class="col-md-12">The following Policy and Procedure has been adopted by the Board of Directors (&ldquo;Board&rdquo;) of the Gleneagle Civic
      Association ("Association") pursuant to Colorado statutes, for encouragement of alternative dispute resolution practices.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row top40">
    <div class="col-md-12"><u>Alternative Dispute Resolution</u>. Finding that the cost and delay of litigation is often an inefficient means of
      resolving disputes between Owners and the Association, the Association wishes to encourage negotiation, facilitation and mediation as
      alternatives to litigation in situations where an Owner(s) may bring an action against the Association and the Association may bring an action
      against an Owner(s) (the &ldquo;Party&rdquo; or &ldquo;Parties&rdquo; when hereinafter referring to the Association or Owner(s), or both
      collectively). Neither party waives any right to pursue whatever legal or other remedial actions available to either party.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row top20">
    <div class="col-md-12">The Association hereby adopts the following alternative dispute resolution policy and procedure:
      <ol type="1">
        <li id="definitions"><u>Definitions</u>
          <ol class="parenAlphaParen">
            <li id="def-negotiation" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4"><u>Negotiation</u>: Bargaining between parties who have a perceived or actual
              conflict of interest. The participants voluntarily meet to educate each other about their needs and interests, to exchange specific
              resources, or to resolve one or more intangible issues. It is more intentional and structured process than the informal discussions
              often used to solve problems.
            </li>
            <li id="def-facilitation" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4"><u>Facilitation</u>: Use of a trained, acceptable, neutral third party to assist
              parties in constructively discussing issues of mutual concern. This is especially useful where larger numbers of people are involved.
              The facilitator helps the parties in managing conflict, and records significant elements of the discussion. If the parties are actually
              in a dispute, the facilitator may help them to clarify points of disagreement.
            </li>
            <li id="def-mediation" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4"><u>Mediation</u>: An extension and elaboration of the negotiation and facilitation
              processes, involving the intervention of a trained, acceptable, neutral third party (with no decisionmaking power) to assist contending
              parties in voluntarily reaching their own mutually agreed-upon settlement of issues in dispute.
            </li>
            <li id="def-arbitration" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4"><u>Arbitration</u>: A process in which people in conflict use an impartial and
              neutral outside party to make a decision for them regarding contested issues. Parties must present evidence, and the arbitrator&rsquo;s
              decision may be advisory or binding. Arbitration of a dispute may be required by contract or by an agency in authority, such as the
              courts, and such arbitration would usually be binding.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="negotiation" class="p-mt-4"><u>Negotiation</u>. Except as provided in Section 6, any party may initiate a request for negotiation,
          stating in writing the nature and details of the disagreement. Within twenty (20) business days of receipt of such request, unless otherwise
          extended by written agreement, a meeting shall be held between the parties to negotiate a resolution in good faith. The parties will
          communicate directly with one another in a good faith effort to reach an agreement that serves the interests of all parties. Should the
          dispute pertain to property issues, each party will be granted the right to inspect the alleged defects or problems at a time convenient to
          all involved.
        </li>
        <li id="facilitation" class="p-mt-4"><u>Facilitation</u>. Except as provided in Section 6, for disputes not resolved by negotiation that
          involve multiple parties or groups seeking the support of an acceptable, neutral third party to assist them in discussing issues of mutual
          concern, any party may request in writing that a facilitator be engaged to help in managing conflict, clarifying the issues in dispute, and
          recording elements of the discussion and in stating the nature and details of the dispute. Within twenty (20) business days of receipt of
          such request, unless otherwise extended by written agreement, the parties will mutually select a facilitator and conduct a facilitated
          meeting. The parties agree to participate in good faith to resolve their disagreement. Any cost of facilitation will be shared equally among
          the parties unless they agree otherwise.
        </li>
        <li id="mediation" class="p-mt-4"><u>Mediation</u>. Except as provided in Section 6, for disputes not resolved by negotiation or facilitation,
          any party may request in writing that the issue be submitted to mediation, and the parties agree to mediate the dispute prior to seeking
          other remedies. If agreed to mediate, the parties further agree to participate in good faith. The role of the mediator is to encourage
          further negotiation between the parties and to assist them in conducting such negotiations. The mediator will not have the power to decide
          how to resolve the dispute but will use recognized, accepted mediation techniques to assist the parties in making that decision themselves.
          The mediator shall be selected by a consensus of the parties involved within twenty (20) business days of the receipt of the request, unless
          otherwise extended by written agreement, and the mediator will help the parties in establishing the date for the mediation meeting. Any cost
          of mediation will be shared equally among the parties unless they and the mediator agree otherwise.
        </li>
        <li id="arbitration" class="p-mt-4"><u>Arbitration</u>. Except as provided in Section 6, if the dispute is not resolved by mediation, the
          parties may submit the matter to binding arbitration. The power to decide the outcome of the dispute will be assigned to the arbitrator, and
          the parties agree to accept the decision of the arbitrator as final and binding upon them. Judgment may be enforced in any court having
          jurisdiction. In making this agreement, the parties waive all rights to appeal the decision of the arbitrator to a court of law and waive
          their rights to file a lawsuit and to have a jury resolve any dispute between them. Colorado law as well as the Colorado Rules of Civil
          Procedure and evidence shall apply to the arbitration proceeding. The parties shall mutually agree on an arbitrator. Any cost of arbitration
          will be shared equally among the parties unless they and the arbitrator agree otherwise. The arbitrator shall have the authority to require
          one party to pay all or a portion of the other party&rsquo;s legal fees.
        </li>
        <li id="exceptions" class="p-mt-4"><u>Exceptions</u>. Notwithstanding the above, the Association shall have no duty to engage in alternative
          dispute resolution for the following actions, conditions or circumstances:
          <ol class="parenAlphaParen">
            <li id="except-a" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">Any suit by the Association for recovery of one or more installments of unpaid
              assessments and other amounts due to the Association;
            </li>
            <li id="except-b" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">Any suit by the Association to obtain a temporary restraining order, injunction or such
              other ancillary relief as the court may deem necessary to preserve the Association&rsquo;s ability to act under and enforce the
              provisions of the Governing Documents;
            </li>
            <li id="except-c" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">Any suit exclusively between Owners, in which the Association is not a Party; or in any
              suit between Owners in which the Association has been named as a defendant; or in any suit between Owners in which the Association has
              chosen to intervene;
            </li>
            <li id="except-d" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">Any suit in which the statute of limitations will expire within less than six (6) months.
              However, although not obligated, the Association may agree to engage in alternative dispute resolution that is conducted simultaneously
              to litigation;
            </li>
            <li id="except-e" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">In the case of a suit brought against multiple Owners, upon expiration of the thirty (30)
              day noticing period, the Association may pursue litigation against any Owner(s) not requesting alternative dispute resolution; or
            </li>
            <li id="except-f" class="parenAlphaParen p-mt-4">Under the circumstance where litigation is ongoing the Association shall not be required
              to engage in alternative dispute resolution procedures for new claims that may arise in conjunction with the litigation.
