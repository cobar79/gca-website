                <h4>Policy</h4>
                It is the policy of the Gleneagle Civic Association (GCA), a Colorado nonprofit corporation, as
                successor in interest to the declarant with respect to the Declaration of Covenants, Restrictions, and
                Charges for Gleneagle subdivisions, to approve variances of these covenants in an equitable manner
                consistent with the best interests of all property owners and residents within the GCA community. This
                will be accomplished by the GCA Board of Directors following the guidance of <a class="decorate"
                    href="/covenants-1#section-143">Section 143</a> of the Declaration and supported by an Architectural
                Control Committee (ACC) made up of GCA members. The cornerstone of this policy is that it provides the
                opportunity for all residents or owners directly affected by a requested variance to make their views
                known to the Board in advance of its decision, should they choose to do so.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>Architectural Control Committee</h4>
                The Architectural Control Committee (ACC) shall comprise a Chairperson and sufficient additional members
                necessary to conduct the business of the committee in an expeditious and effective manner. The committee
                will receive and examine each request for a variance from a GCA member, submitted in compliance with <a
                    class="decorate" href="/covenants-1#section-143">Section 143</a> , and process the request as
                described below. The term &ldquo;variance&rdquo; is interpreted to mean any deviation from the covenant
                requirements for new residences or existing residences or property.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>Procedures</h4>
                <div>Upon receipt of a written or electronic request for a variance from a property owner, the
                    Chairperson of the ACC shall review the package to ensure it has been prepared in accordance with
                    these guidelines and the documents appended above. If the package has been prepared correctly, it
                    shall be logged in the GCA Administrative website with all supporting documents and showing the date
                    and time received. <a href="/editor_upload/File/ACC/VarianceProcessingForm.pdf" target="_blank"

                    meeting days following receipt of the variance request package. Any property owners who will be
                    affected by the variances shall be provided the opportunity to make their views known at the
                    meeting. At the meeting or within one week after the meeting, the Board shall make its decision, and
                    the Chairperson of the ACC shall inform the requester in written or electronic communication of the
                    decision. A record of the decision and all documentation shall be uploaded to the Administrative
                    website.</div>

                <h4>Special Circumstances</h4>
                <a class="decorate" href="/covenants-1#section-141">Section 141</a> requires that variance requests must
                be either approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days of the request. Otherwise, the request shall
                stand approved. If the timing of the request makes it impossible or impractical for the Board of
                Directors to review it at a regular meeting, the ACC Chairperson shall have the option of distributing
                it via e-mail and conducting an e-mail vote.
                <div>These procedures do not apply to requests governed by the general purpose approvals previously

                <a class="decorate" href="/covenants-1#section-143">Section 143</a> of the Declaration, under the
                heading of Variances, states that &ldquo;Declarant shall have authority to grant for a lot or building
                site a variance from the terms of one or more of the foregoing sections subject to terms and conditions
                fixed by Declarant as will not be contrary to the interests of the Owners and residents of the
                Subdivision where, owing to exceptional and extraordinary circumstances, literal enforcement of all of
                those Sections will result in unnecessary hardship.&rdquo; The Declaration goes on to stipulate that
                following an application for a variance:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Declarant shall call a meeting of Owners of adjoining lots &hellip; to be held at

                        least 20 days in advance, at which meeting all Owners shall have opportunity to appear and
                        express their views. Whether or not anyone appears at the meeting &hellip; Declarant shall
                        within one week after the meeting either grant or deny the variance.</li>
                    <li>A variance &hellip; shall run with the lot or building site &hellip;</li>
                    <li>If a variance is denied another application for a similar variance &hellip; may not be made for
                        a period of one year.</li>
                    <li>A variance shall not be granted unless Declarant shall find that all of the following conditions
                        exist:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>the variance will not authorize the operation of a use other than private, single-family

                            <li>literal enforcement of the Sections above enumerated will result in unnecessary
                                hardship;</li>
                            <li>the variance will not substantially or permanently injure the use of other property in
                                the Subdivision;</li>
                            <li>the variance will not alter the essential character of the Subdivision;</li>
                            <li>the variance will not weaken the general purposes of these covenants;</li>
                            <li>the variance will be in harmony with the spirit and purpose of these covenants;</li>
                            <li>the circumstances leading the applicant to seek a variance are unique to the lot or
                                building site or its owner and are not applicable generally to lots in the Subdivision

                <dl>
                    <dd>Very bold or bright colors. High gloss paints are discouraged.</dd>
                    <dd>Very dark colors, except for accent trim. All fluorescent, neon, day-glo, or similar colors.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>Colors that are in obvious discord with the surrounding area and with the dominant color themes
                        found within the GCA.</dd>
                    <dd>Colors that overpower the surroundings.</dd>
                    <dd>Primary colors - pure red, yellow, blue, green, grown, black, white - should not be considered
                        as the &ldquo;main&rdquo; house color, but may be considered for trim or accent depending on the
                        overall impact of the paint scheme. Pinks, purples, oranges,</dd>
                    <dd>Metallic colors such as gold, silver, or bronze.</dd>
                    <dd>Colors that are non-traditional or unusual for houses in our area, such as lime-green, teal,
                        violet, etc.</dd>
                    <dd>Generally, house colors that mimic those of adjacent houses or directly across the street may
                        not be approved because the resultant &ldquo;cookie cutter&rdquo; theme would be in contrast to
                        the character of the GCA neighborhoods.</dd>

                attempt to create a sense of community and character to Gleneagle. By doing such, we are striving for a
                pleasant and valuable balance of rural/suburban, structured/unstructured, and individual/community.
