                    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                    <div class="container left">The Gleneagle Civic Association (GCA) is a legal homeowners association
                        (HOA) comprising 702 properties in northern El Paso County. The GCA was established on 20
                        January 1995 by filing Articles of Incorporation with the State of Colorado; and it is the
                        successor to the original developer and Declarant, the Skiland Corporation. The properties
                        within the jurisdiction of the GCA are detailed in the Articles of Incorporation. Membership in
                        the GCA is compulsory for all these properties.</div>
                    <div class="container left">The Colorado Common Interest Ownership Act (CCIOA), Colorado Revised
                        Statute &sect; 38-33.3-101 et seq., as amended, provides increased protection to homeowners, and
                        specifically grants to HOAs, such as the GCA, the power to adopt Rules &amp; Regulations.
                        Moreover, the By-Laws of the GCA empower the GCA Board of Directors to enact Rules &amp;
                        Regulations as necessary to interpret the Covenants. The Rules &amp; Regulations detailed in
                        this document have been developed in consonance with these authorities, and they are hereby
                        approved. They are enforceable unless specific issues prove inconsistent with the CCIOA and
                        other relevant laws.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="container left">The GCA is directed by its Articles of Incorporation to enforce its
                    Covenants, and it is recognized that such enforcement will necessarily involve some interpretation.
                    So that the interpretation and enforcement of the Covenants will be consistent over time, and so
                    that the Architectural Control Committee (ACC), the Covenant Control Committee (CCC), and GCA
                    residents will have a ready reference to specific interpretable Covenants, the Board of Directors
                    (BOD) has summarized those Covenants deemed to require interpretation in these Rules &amp;
                    Regulations, along with their adopted interpretations. For situations that may require further
                    interpretation, a GCA Board opinion will be sought before a judgment is rendered. It is well
                    recognized that consistent Covenant interpretation and enforcement will generate substantial
                    benefits both to individual homeowners and also to the community as a whole. These are the
                    overarching objectives behind this document.</div>
                <div class="container left">By authority of the GCA By-Laws, these Rules &amp; Regulations may be
                    amended by the Board of Directors as necessary. All General Purpose Approvals published in years
                    prior to the effective date of these Rules &amp; Regulations are hereby rescinded. They have been
                    incorporated in original or modified form in the appropriate sections of these Rules &amp;
                    Regulations, or they have been republished as separate policy memoranda.</div>
                <div class="container left">The GCA acknowledges that some of the provisions outlined in this document
                    may be contrary to your understanding of the Covenants and of the GCA&rsquo;s expectations when you
                    became a resident of Gleneagle. If that is the case, and if you became a resident before this
                    document became effective, the GCA will grant you <u>ONE YEAR</u> from the date of this document to
                    seek relief by submitting a variance request supported by related justification.</div>

                        restrict the placement of both video and non-video antennas covered by FCC rules so long as the
                        restriction does not interfere unreasonably with signal quality, does not cause an unreasonable
                        delay, and does not cause the resident to incur an unreasonable expense. HOAs may also require

                    <div class="col-md-11">In 1999, the GCA Board authorized overnight driveway parking of personal
                        transportation vehicles without any restrictions. Since then, the privilege of driveway parking
                        has been abused in a number of instances to the extent that three or four vehicles are often
                        observed in some driveways on a regular basis. This practice detracts seriously from the
                        appearance of the neighborhood. Accordingly, the unrestricted approval of overnight driveway
                        parking is hereby rescinded, and the following rules &amp; regulations shall apply instead.

                        regularly in the driveway will normally not be adequate justification for such driveway parking.
